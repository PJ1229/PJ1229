## Hey! My name is PJ. Here's some stuff about me! 👋
- 🔭 I'm currently working on developing my own website
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Data Structures & Algorithms and Ordinary Differential Equations
- 🏫 I'm currently a freshman at Wayne State University majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.
- 🔨 I love tinkering whether that be with 3D printers, electronics, or programming!
- 🎥 I like to work on short films on the side. I'm hoping to publish some to my Youtube Channel in the future.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with anything AI related. I find it fascinating but confusing.
