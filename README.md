<h1>Hi! I'm PJ ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I'm currently studying computer engineering at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. I am passionate about film, activism, and robotics, and many of my projects relate to these three topics. Here's what I'm working on right now:</p>
<li>Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ootdfashn/">OOTD</a>: a fashion app and brand promoting inclusivity, diversity, and exploration</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yazaki-north-america/posts/?feedView=all">Yazaki</a> Intern: under the Ford Business Unit</li>

<p>Aside from these personal projects, I am involved in numerous other activities. As a member of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fasa_umich/">FASA</a> at UMICH, I am often caught hanging out with fellow Filipino-Americans ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­. I also have always loved running since highschool, and am currently training for the Detroit Half Marathon. Some other ways I spend my time are:</p>
<li>Making films: I post many short films on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pj.k1m/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pjkim61">YouTube</a>!</li>
<li>Playing Basketball: I am a lifelong Detroit Pistons fan!</li>
