<h1>Hi! I'm PJ ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I'm currently studying electrical & computer engineering at Wayne State University. I am passionate about film, activism, and robotics, and many of my projects relate to these three topics. Here are my biggest current projects:</p>
<li>Founder of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/techtapes" >TechTapes</a>: a non profit organization making technology more accessible through media.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/PJ1229/Autonomous-Car-Project">Autonomous Car Project</a>: a personal project to better understand robotics and autonomous vehicles</li>

<p>Aside from these personal projects, I am involved in numerous other activities. As a member of <a href="https://www.filsoc.org/">FILSOC</a> at WSU, I am often caught hanging out with fellow Filipino-Americans ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­. I also have always loved running since highschool, and am currently training for the Detroit Half Marathon. Some other ways I spend my time are:</p>
<li>Making films: I post many short films on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pj.k1m/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pjkim61">YouTube</a>!</li>
<li>Playing Basketball: I am a lifelong Detroit Pistons fan!</li>
<li>Social Media: I run WSU's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wsu_ieee/">IEEE</a> social media and post hackathon reels on my Instagram</li>
