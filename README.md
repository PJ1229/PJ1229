<h1>Hi! I'm PJ</h1>
<p>I'm currently studying electrical & computer engineering at Wayne State University. I am passionate about film, activism, and robotics, and many of my projects relate to these three topics. Here's what I've been working on:</p>
<li>Founder of <a target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/techtapes">TechTapes</a>: a non profit organization seeking to make technology more accessible by spreading awareness through media.</li>
<li><a target="blank" href="https://github.com/PJ1229/Autonomous-Car-Project">Autonomous Car Project</a>: a personal project to better understand robotics and autonomous vehicles</li>
