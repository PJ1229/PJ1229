## Hey! My name is PJ. Here's some stuff about me! 👋
- 🔭 I'm currently working on my <a target="_blank" href="https://pj-kim-website-f1f51094eca1.herokuapp.com/">personal portfolio site</a> and a problem bank website for the Plymouth District Library
- 🌱 I'm currently learning website development with HTML/CSS/JS
- 🏫 I'm currently a freshman at Wayne State University majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.
- 🔨 I love tinkering whether that be with 3D printers, electronics, or programming!
- 🎥 I like to work on short films on the side. I'm hoping to publish some to my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2hlN8nkIE6jQl7qLvJFRNA">Youtube Channel</a> in the future.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with anything AI related. I find it fascinating but confusing.
